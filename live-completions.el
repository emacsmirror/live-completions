;;; Commentary:

;; This packages provides a minibuffer completion UI.  It pops up the
;; traditional *Completions* buffer and keeps it updated as you type
;; in the minibuffer.  Besides the traditional multicolumn view of the
;; completions, this package offers a single column view ---in case
;; the changing number of columns of the traditional view proves too
;; dizzying.
